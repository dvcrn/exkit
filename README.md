# In very early alpha stage. Not at all usable!

# Introduction

Exkit (__Ex__tension__Kit__) is a framework for creating modern, javascript based cross browser extensions. Write your extension once and compile it for opera, chrome and safari at the same time - without any extra effort!

Exkit is built on top of gulp and babel to give you the newest es6 features right at your finger tips. 


# How does it work? 

Exkit tries to be a abstraction layer on top of the browser API. You communicate with exkit, exkit with your browser. Because of that, exkit can rapidly swap out the browser layer and replace it with a different one during build. Right now supported are: __opera__, __firefox__ and __chrome__.

# Technology
